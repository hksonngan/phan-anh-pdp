- make sure to also change mitk, itk, cgal path in the pdp CMakeLists file
- set the mitk path in the CmakeLists.txt for every tool.
- change itk path in cmake gui (and perhaps in some CMakeLists file)
- in Bulge tool:
set(MITK_SOURCE_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../../../pdp-mitk/MITK" CACHE PATH "Path to the MITK source folder")
set(MITK_BINARY_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../../../pdp-mitk-build/mitk-build-64-rel/MITK-build" CACHE PATH "Path to the MITK superbuild folder to link to")

- bulge tool: binary dir = hendrik pdp: build dir/MITK-build

- bulge tool does not include mitkCoreExt???
