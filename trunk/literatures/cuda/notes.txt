- in reduction example
	    // warm-up
        reduce<T>(size, numThreads, numBlocks, whichKernel, d_idata, d_odata);
	the above command does not affect anything because d_idata is intact and d_odata is not processed and will get overrided later on.
	Blocks cannot synchronize so reduce_kernel is called multiple times: First call reduces from numValues to numThreads. Each subsequent call reduces by half. Ping pong between input and output buffers
	
	all reduction functions: copy from global memory to shared memory within one block.
	
	reduce0: each step reduce by half: s=1 => all odd elements get integrated into the even elements.
	s=2: all 2*s+s get integrated into 2*s. For better visualization: make a table with columns corresponding to tid and rows corresponding to s.
