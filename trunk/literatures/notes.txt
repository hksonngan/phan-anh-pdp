- 1st priority: 3d live wire => live mesh
- 2nd Voxel representation or meta model between voxel and surface
- 3rd CUDA
- 4th interaction

coding:
- void pdp::Toolbar::GetCurrentDataStorage();
- void pdp::DataManager::ReinitSelectedNodes(bool);
- On application startup the ITK object factory will search a list of directories from the environment variable ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH. Set this environment variable to your binary directory (containing the dll file).

approaches and improvements:
- extrude in the z direction with some +/- error tolerance proportion to the z-spacing and apply 2d live wire
- gradient in 3D, geodesic, marching cube idea.
- exponential cost function and other kinds, no need to quantize the cost with general priority queue.
- volume rendering and live mesh + similar intensity => marching cube and region growing. => maximize betweeness and minimize intra-object.
- guided marching cube, radio wave propagation, crack propagation, model stress tensor, material property.
- dynamics => flow => curvature flow => active contour :((
- 3D live mesh is not promising. => switch to active surface model => juelich

- scale for snake: one can allow the snake to come to equilibrium on a very blurry energy functional and then slowly reduce the blurring. The result is minimization by scale-continuation.
- 3D live wire is not promising, the sphere tool is not intuitive, snake has good interation tool => combination of 2D live wire and 3D active surface model in cuda.
