- 1st priority: 3d live wire => live mesh
- 2nd Voxel representation or meta model between voxel and surface
- 3rd CUDA
- 4th interaction

coding:
- void pdp::Toolbar::GetCurrentDataStorage();
- void pdp::DataManager::ReinitSelectedNodes(bool);
- On application startup the ITK object factory will search a list of directories from the environment variable ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH. Set this environment variable to your binary directory (containing the dll file).

approaches and improvements:
- extrude in the z direction with some +/- error tolerance proportion to the z-spacing and apply 2d live wire
- gradient in 3D, geodesic, marching cube idea.
- exponential cost function and other kinds, no need to quantize the cost with general priority queue.
- volume rendering and live mesh + similar intensity => marching cube and region growing. => maximize betweeness and minimize intra-object.
- guided marching cube, radio wave propagation, crack propagation, model stress tensor, material property.
- dynamics => flow => curvature flow => active contour :((
- 3D live mesh is not promising. => switch to active surface model => juelich

- scale for snake: one can allow the snake to come to equilibrium on a very blurry energy functional and then slowly reduce the blurring. The result is minimization by scale-continuation.
- 3D live wire is not promising, the sphere tool is not intuitive, snake has good interation tool => combination of 2D live wire and 3D active surface model in cuda.

- active contour is good because it has the term for feature points attraction.

- the back of thickening is anchored by some spring model.

- live wire in 3D => model the 3D neighborhood: 26 neighbors.

- Live Wire performed better than SimpleSeg in both repeatability and segmentation time. We observed that the users learned Live Wire more quickly than Live Mesh, largely due to the fact that they had difficulty navigating and interacting in the three-dimensional SimpleSeg interface.

- live wire snaps to corners term.

- The main advantages of using level sets is that arbitrarily complex shapes can be modeled and topological changes such as merging and splitting are handled implicitly.
