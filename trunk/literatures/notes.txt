- 1st priority: 3d live wire => live mesh
- 2nd Voxel representation or meta model between voxel and surface
- 3rd CUDA
- 4th interaction

coding:
- void pdp::Toolbar::GetCurrentDataStorage();
- void pdp::DataManager::ReinitSelectedNodes(bool);
- On application startup the ITK object factory will search a list of directories from the environment variable ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH. Set this environment variable to your binary directory (containing the dll file).

approaches and improvements:
- extrude in the z direction with some +/- error tolerance proportion to the z-spacing and apply 2d live wire
- gradient in 3D, geodesic, marching cube idea.
- exponential cost function and other kinds, no need to quantize the cost with general priority queue.
