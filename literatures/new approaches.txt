- ALE: Lagrange explicitly tracking of the boundary. This results in the distortion of the boundary mesh. => mesh surgery.
Euler model boundary by an implicit level set function which is usually a sign distance function.

- Heaviside in Chan-Vese; conversion using finite elements as oppose to finite difference (mesh vs voxel). first extract mesh using EMC.

- Chan-Vese operates on voxel data. parameter estimation, add user force terms as source or sink or spring force.
Or prescribed external velocity field.

- graph cut: works on voxel data. put anchors, weight to make the cut run through it.

- convert between voxel and mesh. marching cube, convert back. feature detection => extended marching cube.
data structure: store all information.

- gradient field, signed distance field.

- Chan-vese: he use existing itk framework. He modified to make the navigation bar and parameter config bar. However, he did not use Spring force in ITK.

- make a quick test to se what happens then think more.

- Chan-vese: integrate drag, spring and push tools for each iteration => conversion is important since it can improve performance and precision. (currently it is slow and not accurate).

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//He is doing only in live-wire
- Hendrik idea about live wire in 3D: triangulate the live wire.
- make the cross from the free point: in xy plane, and in z direction (zx or zy). from the cross make the geometry out of it.

- jump to the middle slice (using arrow key) and refine the segmentation made by interpolating the start and end slices.

- combine live-wire and bulge tools

- the wall is solved by Laplacian framework.
