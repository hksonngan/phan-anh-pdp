- Chan-Vese operates on voxel data. parameter estimation, add user force terms.

- graph cut: works on voxel data. put anchors, weight to make the cut run through it.

- convert between voxel and mesh. marching cube, convert back. feature detection => extended marching cube.
data structure: store all information.

- gradient field, signed distance field.

- Hendrik idea about live wire in 3D: triangulate the live wire.
