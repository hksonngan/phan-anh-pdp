- angle in radian: theta = L/R where L is the arc length. then 1/R = theta/L = curvature. Curvature of the curve at the point P: pick a small curve segment around P, it corresponds to the arc of a very big circle somewhere then just compute: d(theta)/d(length).
- If the tangents at the ends of the segment are represented by unit vectors, it is easy to show that in this limit, the magnitude of the difference vector is equal to d(theta).
- In the limit dT/ds will be in the direction N and the curvature describes the speed of rotation of the frame: T'(s) = k(s).N(s) where the curve has been reparameterized w.r.t. arc length s.
- curvature of level contours: k = div.(grad(I(x, y))), see "Active Contours without Edges and Curvature Analysis for Endoscopic Image Classification".
- notation in "Curvature formulas for implicit curves and surfaces" proof of implicit curvature:
dN/ds = (dNx/ds, dNy/ds) => chain rule (dN/dx . dx/ds, dN/dy . dy/ds)
 = (dx/ds, dy/ds). dN/dx,	0
				   0,	dN/dy
				   
this is the proof of snake: curvature of level contour.

- An earlier approach to corner detection is to detect points where the curvature of level curves and the gradient magnitude are simultaneously high. A differential way to detect such points is by computing the rescaled level curve curvature (the product of the level curve curvature and the gradient magnitude raised to the power of three) => snake terminates at corners.

Hamiltonian H = T + V, where T: kinetic energy - 1/2.mv^2, and V: potential energy
and the Lagrangian, or difference between kinetic and potential energy, is: L = T - V

- However, since most (if not all) of the Cartesian grid points will not lie on the interface, most of the points on our Cartesian mesh have velocity V
identically equal to zero, causing the V.grad(phi) term in equation (3.2) to vanish. This in turn implies that d(phi)/dt = 0 almost everywhere, so that the interface mostly (or completely if no points happen to fall on the interface) incorrectly sits still. => parameter of level set from Hendrik (overshooting) => heaviside function in Chan-Vese.
